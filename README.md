Why this architecture?

Clear separation of concerns

Easy to maintain and test

Scales well for larger applications

🔑 Authentication Flow

User logs in → receives Access Token + Refresh Token

Access token is used for protected routes

Refresh token generates a new access token

Middleware validates JWT and injects userID into request context
